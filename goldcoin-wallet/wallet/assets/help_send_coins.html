			You have initiated the process of sending coins.
			You came here either through the main screen or by clicking on a GoldCoin URL in your mobile browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, you enter the GoldCoin address to pay to.
			The address will autocomplete from known entries in your address book.
			You can also scan QR codes with GoldCoin addresses or GoldCoin requests by pressing the QR button in the action bar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next, you can see how many GoldCoins you can spend at the moment.
			Any difference to the balance from the main screen is still unconfirmed and can thus not yet be spent.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last, you enter the amount to pay and the fee you are offering.
			Currently, a minimum fee of GLD 0.1 is required in order to get your transaction processed.  The fee may be larger depending on the transaction.  You can specify a larger fee if you like.  Fee's go to the miners.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can enter a transaction while being offline.
			It will be sent on next restart of GoldCoin Wallet.
			If you want a transaction to be processed as fast as possible, make sure you are well connected (i.e. on a WLAN) and have good GoldCoin connectivity (see GoldCoin connectivity indicator in left notification area).
		</p>
		<p>
			Note:
			Transactions cannot be undone!
			Always check the receiving address.
